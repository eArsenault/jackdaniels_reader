# Jack Daniels Reader

Simple Python tool to interpret and generate metrics for running workouts.

## Description

Many workouts prescribed by Jack Daniels can be complicated, often written as a string of numbers and paces. One such example of a workout is "2E + 3x(1T + 1 min rest) + 3x(3 min I + 2 min J) + 4x(200R + 200J) + 2E". The idea behind this project is to generate metrics for each workout, mainly distance covered + estimated duration (and have a little fun with code).

## Next Steps

* Add wider variety of paces
* Add metric and imperial distances in the same string
* Add time-based intervals
* Can we feed this to a whole table/spreadsheet?
